## Data Collected Automatically
The bots and services do not automatically store any information and never will! We matter the pricacy of our users!

## Data collected using commands!

Feedback on any and all provided services is appreciated. When you submit comments, suggestions, bug reports, and any other forms of feedback, that will help in the phase of development of additional commands and the credits will be given to you!
